These pre-approved streamers and content creators will give fans the chance to hear from their favorite content creators alongside the main broadcast. Additional details about the selected co-streamers will be announced via LoL Esports channels.</p>

                       include up to three clips per match, as long as each individual clip
                       does not exceed the 15 minute time limit
